							<h2>Hello! I'm a Software Engineer passionate about social impact tech work, looking to join a mission-driven organization.</h2>
						</header>
						<p> I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Cambridge University in the UK, three years of Graduate studies in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as industry internships at Google and software contracting work for an architecture startup. </p>
						<p> I also have a long-standing interest in science communication as one way to amplify the impact of technical work. While at CMU, I co-founded <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-org/pcr/">Public Communication for Researchers</a>, a professional development program teaching graduate students to talk about their work to policy makers, the media, and the public. Later, I worked as the Program Coordinator of a <a href="https://scienceambassadors.org/">National Academy of Sciences project</a> to make energy and climate expertise easily available to community leaders and inform decision-making on issues like green infrastructure or pollution. </p>
						<p> In my free time I love to hike, cook with friends, and tend to the container garden slowly taking over every inch of my porch. </p>
